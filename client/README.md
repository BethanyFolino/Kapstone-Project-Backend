Retrospective Notes:
Week 1:
What went well - the group strategy and communication have allowed us to be less stressed at the start of the project. The backend went well in terms of getting set up, but was very difficult. We made a lot of progress getting the backend going.

What didn't go well - could have more participation from all group members.

What we got done - set up backend using MongoDB; made store, login, registration.

What we are doing next - work on incorporating the 3rd party API, connecting the frontend to the backend, set up the second view, set up store.
